\section{Used files}
Sequences were downloaded from Pfam as fasta files, all the preparations were made on this extension as well.
Later programs for tree creation required specific files versions.
To convert between formats and visually check quality of the sequences program AliView was used.
Files were converted into Phylip for PhyML and FastME programs and into nexus file for MrBayes.
Result files were different from each tree building algorithm, yet all consensus trees were based on .json style type of the tree.
Some algorithms were expanding this format with additional information like sequence names directly built in.
Another expansion was the family id as a random and itself meaningless number which later helped with much easier tree coloring.
All the consensus trees are possible to import into popular tree visualization programs like FigTree used in this project.
Many additional files were created such as .mcmc statistic file from MrBayes, profiles or CLANS clustering files.
All of those files are precisely described in manuals to those programs.
No unusual modifications were made there other than analysis of those files or appending standard information via extra scripts (like coloring groups in CLANS).
